<h2>How my course help me?</h2>
<p id="help" >I learn how to write academic writing ,use python and some knowladge of business ,marking ,computing and techology in year one couress. Nowadays, many professions need some technologies's knowledge.In the course 119COM Current Technologies,I leaarn the some knowladge about technologies such as IP , HTML and AI.The course let me know more how nowadays technologies works.Moreover, if I want to the be a programmer, I must know how to computing .In SPE10117 Foundation in Information Systems and 121COM Introduction to Computing, I leaarn how to use python to write some small programmer and do testing.Nevertheless,in 126COM Business Decision Making , I learn some business knowladge such as limited company , income statement and asset.At least, in the year one courses, I do some assignments about deciding a product or app and how making it.I try how the do the project, communication with group members and share my opinion though these assigments.These help me with perparing my technology career.
<br></p>
<h2>How I am developing</h2>
<p id="develop">I learn more in the year one course and I may develop as a professional within IT after I practice more anddo more revision.If I want to be a test engineer in MiHOYO. I have to learn more about wedsite , browser and computing language such as python, c or C++.Therefore I have to read more article or book about the technology and how to use the computing language.In next three or four years, I need to pay attentation to the new information about the job , try to take more class about it.Andã€€I have to gain more experience in this area if I want to gain this job.
<br></p>
<h2>Reflection about myself</h2>
<p id="reflection">
<br>When I was doing the assigment grabe.py, I think that my profromation was not bad.Althought I could not catch up the class in the leature time, I could catch up it after class. When I was doing testing, I find that the my program have lots of error and I took a long time to solve one error because I was not good at it.
<br>Without a doubt, my current capabilities could not match my aspirations.Now, I am not good at computing, I take a long time to finish an assigment. And I am not not familiar with the technology knowladge. I still have to learn more and practice more. On top of these I need to gain some work experience and improve my communation skill.
<br>As for the review of how me feel about the picture me have painted of myself.I think that I am lazy. I always do nothing unless the deadline is coming.I seldom do revision before the test. I am trying to change my lifestyle and solve my lazy problem now.
